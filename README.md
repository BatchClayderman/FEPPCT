# FEPPCT

This is a possible implementation of the FEPPCT cryptography scheme in Java programming language based on the JPBC library, which is the baseline of the [II-FPPCT cryptography scheme](https://github.com/BatchClayderman/II-FPPCT). 

This repository is a part of the [cryptography schemes](https://github.com/BatchClayderman/Cryptography-Schemes).
